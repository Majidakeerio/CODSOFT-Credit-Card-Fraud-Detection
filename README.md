# CODSOFT-Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection

## Overview
This project aims to build a machine learning model to identify fraudulent credit card transactions. It preprocesses and normalizes the transaction data, handles class imbalance issues, and trains a random forest classifier to classify transactions as fraudulent or genuine. The model's performance is evaluated using metrics like precision, recall, and F1-score.
